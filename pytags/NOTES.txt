In the cmakelists I added "SHARED" to the library creation. It's no longer a static library, 
now it's a shared library. This occurs in line 13:
 `add_library(apriltag ${sources})` -> `add_library(apriltag SHARED ${sources})`

I moved the zarray_get function definition from zarray.h to zarray.c (declaration remains in zarray.h).
This allows me to access this function from the shared library. 

Using two classes for the python implementation.
1) pytag_detector
2) pytag_info
The pytag_detector initializes all of the c functions in the constructor, it can load .pnm files, 
and it can process those images. The return value is a pytag_info object. This object contains
all of the relevant tag info stored in a list of dictionaries. It also contains a representation
of the picture. The info can be printed, accessed from the class variables, or displayed visually.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Questions:
How do the tag families work? Should I load all of them, or does it need to be selective? How are they commonly used and which ones are most normal?

Thoughts on loading a non pnm image? It's awful... So there's that.


Stride is bytes/line
Maybe want it to be a multiple of eight. 
stride is a multiple of the alignemnt


want to do:
1) Make the class more stateless. Remove self.img, self.c_img. Make process just take an img. 
2) Get key for robot lab.
3) Run camera calibration.
4) Set up ros folder (farnsworth, same credentials as last semester).
5) How can you measure the accuracy of the 3d transformation estimation. How can we model that error, and get ground truth of that.
6) rename things, move libc into init.


5) Read more about graphslam and fastslam. Pick a good sparse slam representation to start out with. Think about how to implement it with the robot.
  -Another thing: 

COMMANDS TO SET UP THE ROBOT:
`roscore`
`roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch`
`roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch`
<whatever script I'm running>
Maybe try '/camera/rgb/image_raw'
