In the cmakelists I added "SHARED" to the library creation. It's no longer a static library, 
now it's a shared library. This occurs in line 13:
 `add_library(apriltag ${sources})` -> `add_library(apriltag SHARED ${sources})`

I moved the zarray_get function definition from zarray.h to zarray.c (declaration remains in zarray.h).
This allows me to access this function from the shared library. 

Using two classes for the python implementation.
1) pytag_detector
2) pytag_info
The pytag_detector initializes all of the c functions in the constructor, it can load .pnm files, 
and it can process those images. The return value is a pytag_info object. This object contains
all of the relevant tag info stored in a list of dictionaries. It also contains a representation
of the picture. The info can be printed, accessed from the class variables, or displayed visually.

Questions:
How do the tag families work? Should I load all of them, or does it need to be selective? How are they
commonly used?

Todo:
Finish mat_d and get homography
Test on abnormal images
Try and get it working through opencv. Want to load a png or numpy image.
